                <h2>A question worth asking:</h2>
                <p>
                    Will this thing I really want actually enrich my life?'
                    We often confuse price with value - what something
                    costs and what it brings to our lives. I try to remind
                    myself of this before every purchase I make.

                <h2>A quote worth repeating:</h2>
                <p>
                    Stan Dale is quoted for having said: "All human
                    behaviour is either an act of love or a cry for love."
                    It's such a critical way of looking at the world: you
                    can't hate others for just wanting to be loved. We are
                    all full of fears which are sometimes expressed
                    through rage or - sadly - even violence.

                <h2>A video worth watching:</h2>
                <p>
                    I was obsessed with this long interview with Henri
                    Cartier Bresson for a while. He offers lessons on
                    humility and the unimportance of yourself and your
                    tools. His English is a little hard to follow, but worth
                    watching in full!

                <h2>A Twitter account worth following:</h2>
                <p>
                    I like following French publisher Thomas Ragon as he
                    regularly shares illustrations and art from often
                    unknown masters from the past.

                <h2>A piece of advice worth passing on:</h2>
                <p>
                    Self-initiated work will more heavily shape your
                    career than 'client work!. We should always do
                    something creative outside of our typical
                    professional obligations. It makes us feel alive and
                    will, eventually, bring new jobs/opportunities our way.
